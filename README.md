# CaliburnWeb

## About
CaliburnWeb was the in-development website for CaliburnHCF, an online multiplayer game. The goal of the site was to
display information regarding the server--game statistics, a link to our store, support, and how to play. We also wanted to display recent news regarding our game. These news posts were being posted on reddit and our website used a Reddit wrapper to listen to announcement posts being made on our subreddit then post them on the homepage of our site.

## Build instructions
1. npm install the dependencies
2. create .env file for reddit service
3. setup mongo database in db.js
